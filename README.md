At the dawn of time, there was a lot of fuss about using Roam Research to augment thinking and decision-making with semi-automated algorithms of thought. Now, they are available via your Command Palette or RR Hotkeys.

**NEW:**
- drastically rewritten for robustness and safety
- added 14 new AOTs:
  - Aims, Goals, Objectives
  - Consequence and Sequel
  - Design/Decision, Outcome, Channels, Action (DODCA)
  - Examine Both Sides
  - First Important Priorities
  - Five Whys
  - Pain Button (Ray Dalio)
  - Recognise, Analyse, Divide
  - REALLY?
  - REAPPRAISED checklist
  - Regret Minimisation
  - Right to Disagree (Cortex Futura)
  - Right to Disagree (Deeper Version)
  - Six Thinking Hats
  - SWOT Analysis

All of the Algorithms can be accessed by the Command Palette and Roam Research hotkeys can be assigned. Further, you can trigger using SmartBlocks flows using the SmartBlock command listed below each item in the list below.

- Other People's Views

There is a lot of previous work in this space, especially from when Roam42 SmartBlocks were first created. There is a public archive of early SmartBlocks available which features of many of these AOT at https://github.com/dvargas92495/SmartBlocks/issues.
