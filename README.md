At the dawn of time, there was a lot of fuss about using Roam Research to augment thinking and decision-making with semi-automated algorithms of thought. Now, they are available via your Command Palette or RR Hotkeys.

Available Algorithms of Thought (AOT):
- Assumptions X-Ray
- Basic Decision
- Difference Engine
- Next Action
- Simple Choice
- Plus, Minus and Interesting
- Want, Impediment, Remedy

Coming Soon:
- Alternatives, Possibilities, Choices
- Consequence and Sequel
- Consider All Factors
- Issue Log
- Other People's Views
- Pain Button
- REALLY?
- REAPPRAISED
- Regret Minimisation
- Right to Disagree
- TOSCA

There is a lot of previous work in this space, especially from when Roam42 SmartBlocks were first created. There is a public archive of early SmartBlocks available which features of many of these AOT at https://github.com/dvargas92495/SmartBlocks/issues.
